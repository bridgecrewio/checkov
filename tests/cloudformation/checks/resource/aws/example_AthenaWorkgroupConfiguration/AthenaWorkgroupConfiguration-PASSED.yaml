# There is some internal conflcits on "Tags" in the Athena WG Docs. And corresponding specs.
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-athena-workgroup.html
# This may mean that the "Tags" in this test data needs to correspondingly change when CF / CF Lint are updated in the future.
