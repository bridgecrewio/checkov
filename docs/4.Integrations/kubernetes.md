# Integrate Checkov with Kubernetes 

## Background

Checkov is built to scan static code and is typically used at build time.  However, resources running in a Kubernetes cluster
can be described in the same way as at build time.  This allows Checkov to run in a cluster with read-only access and report
 on the same violations.  

## Execution

To run Checkov in your cluster you must have Kubernetes CLI access to the cluster.  

To execute a job against your cluster, run the following manifest.  

```$bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/master/kubernetes/checkov-job.yaml
```

Review the output of the job.  

```$bash
kubectl get jobs -n checkov
kubectl logs job/checkov -n checkov
```
