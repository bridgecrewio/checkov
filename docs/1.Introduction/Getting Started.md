# Getting Started

The installation is quick and straightforward - install, configure input & scan.


```bash
# install from pypi using pip 
pip install checkov


# select an input folder that contains your terraform plan files
checkov -d /user/tf
```

## Scan result sample (CLI)

Consider the following Terraform configuration of an S3 bucket:
```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  region        = var.region
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  }
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  logging {
    target_bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id}"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        kms_master_key_id = "${aws_kms_key.mykey.arn}"
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
  acl           = "private"
}
```
The appropriate output report is:

```bash
Passed checks: 4, Failed checks: 0, Skipped checks: 0

Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access."
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25
```
The scanned bucket's configuration seems to comply with the available ``aws_s3_bucket`` resource type checks.

Suppose that now the bucket is used for static content hosting, and thus requires to configured with 
allowed public access:
```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  region        = var.region
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  }
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  logging {
    target_bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id}"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        kms_master_key_id = "${aws_kms_key.mykey.arn}"
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
  acl           = "public-read"
}
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

```
The output report would then contain the failed check:
```bash
Passed checks: 3, Failed checks: 1, Skipped checks: 0

Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket

	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access."
	FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25

		1 | resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
		2 |   region        = var.region
		3 |   bucket        = local.bucket_name
		4 |   force_destroy = true

		6 |   tags = {
		7 |     Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"

		14 |     target_prefix = "log/"
		15 |   }

		20 |         sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
		21 |       }
		22 |     }
		23 |   }
		24 |   acl           = "public-read"
		25 | }

```
The corresponding check would now fail, and the report will include the appropriate failing configuration
source code.
 
In order to skip the failed check, we annotate the bucket with a suppression comment (which needs to appear inside the resource scope):
```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:The bucket is a public static content host
  region        = var.region
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true
  tags = {
    Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  }
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  logging {
    target_bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id}"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        kms_master_key_id = "${aws_kms_key.mykey.arn}"
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
  acl           = "public-read"
}
```

Checkov would then skip check ``CKV_AWS_20``, and the output report would be:

```bash
Passed checks: 3, Failed checks: 0, Skipped checks: 1

Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-25


Check: "S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access."
	SKIPPED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	Suppress comment: The bucket is a public static content host
	File: /example.tf:1-25
```

## Export scan to JSON
For the sake of the example, we use the previous bucket configuration and disable it;s versioning is disabled for a check to fail.

```bash
checkov -d /user/tf -o json
```

### Sample policy

Each Checkov policy is defined by resources it scans and expected values for related resource blocks. 

For example, a policy that ensures all data is stored in S3 is versioned, scans the ``versioning`` configuration for all ``aws_s3_bucket`` supported resources. The `scan_resource_conf` is a method that defines the scan's expected behavior, i.e. ``versioning_block['enabled']``

```python
from checkov.common.models.enums import CheckResult, CheckCategories
from checkov.terraform.checks.resource.base_resource_check import BaseResourceCheck
class S3Versioning(BaseResourceCheck):
    def __init__(self):
        name = "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is versioned"
        id = "CKV_AWS_21"
        supported_resources = ['aws_s3_bucket']
        categories = [CheckCategories.BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY]
        super().__init__(name=name, id=id, categories=categories, supported_resources=supported_resources)
    def scan_resource_conf(self, conf):
        if 'versioning' in conf.keys():
            versioning_block = conf['versioning'][0]
            if versioning_block['enabled'][0]:
                return CheckResult.SUCCESS
        return CheckResult.FAILURE
scanner = S3Versioning()
```

Consider the following Terraform AWS S3 bucket configuration:
```
# example_versioning_pass.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  region        = var.region
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  }
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

```

Running `checkov -d ./example_versioning_pass.tf -o cli` would yield a `PASSED` check result for the `S3Versioning` scanner:

```bash
...
Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	PASSED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example.tf:1-24
...
```

If the scanned configuration would have been without bucket versioning enabled, the corresponding check would fail:

Configuration:

```bash
example_acl_fail.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  region        = var.region
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Name = "foo-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  }
  versioning {
    enabled = false
  }
}

```
Run result: 


```bash
> checkov -d ./example_versioning_fail.tf -o cli

Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	File: /example_versioning_fail.tf:1-12

		1 | resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
		2 |   region        = var.region
