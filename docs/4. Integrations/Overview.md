In addition to integrating with your code repository, Checkov can also integrate with your automated build pipeline via CI/CD providers. When your build tests run, Checkov will scan your infrastructure as code files for misconfigurations.

Read how to integrate Checkov with:

* [Jenkins](doc:jenkins)
* [Bitbucket Cloud Pipelines](doc:bitbucket-cloud-pipelines)
* [GitHub Actions](doc:github-actions)
* [Gitlab CLI](doc:gitlab-cli)
