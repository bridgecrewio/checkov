# Git History
Checkov supports scanning of secrets in git history to identify and flag secrets, that might not be in the head commit of the branch but are still visible by accessing the git history of the repo.
Checkov fetches all the available commits and uses same scan as the Checkov 'secrets' checkov framework to search for secrets in the diff available from git history.
Each secret found can be traced to the first commit in which it appeared and the last commit that contained the secret if it was removed.


## Git History scanning

Git history scan uses the same signatures and models as a regular secrets scan.
The only difference is that the root directory is the path to either the root git directory or the bare git repo.
Using the `--scan-secrets-history` flag will scan git history for secrets only. This will not scan for other issues such as IaC misconfiguration. 
Use `--secrets-history-timeout` to set how long the secrets scan will run on history before stopping. If the timeout was not enough to finish the run, no results will be returned.  The default is `12h`.

A run with a timeout of `12h` by default:
```bash
checkov -d <git dir> --scan-secrets-history --bc-api-key <your_api_key>
```

A run with a timeout of `1h`:
```bash
checkov -d <git dir> --scan-secrets-history --secrets-history-timeout 1h --bc-api-key <your_api_key>
```
