    # PR Title
    Be aware that we use the title to create changelog automatically and therefore only allow specific prefixes
    - break:    to indicate a breaking change, this supersedes any of the types
    - feat:     to indicate new features or checks
    - fix:      to indicate a bugfix or handling of edge cases of existing checks
    - docs:     to indicate an update to our documentation
    - chore:    to indicate adjustments to workflow files or dependency updates
    - platform: to indicate a change needed for the platform
    Additionally a scope is needs to be added to the prefix, which indicates the targeted framework, in doubt choose 'general'.
    #    
    Allowed prefixs:
    ansible|argo|arm|azure|bicep|bitbucket|circleci|cloudformation|dockerfile|github|gha|gitlab|helm|kubernetes|kustomize|openapi|sca|secrets|serverless|terraform|general|graph|terraform_plan|terraform_json
