## Description
Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code. It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform and detects security and compliance misconfigurations. 

Checkov is written in Python and provides a simple method to write and manage policies. It follows the CIS Foundations benchmarks where applicable.

 ## Features

 * [50+ built-in policies](docs/3.Scans/resource-scans.md) cover security and compliance best practices for AWS, Azure & Google Cloud.
 * Policies support variable scanning by building a dynamic code dependency graph (coming soon).
 * Supports in-line suppression of accepted risks or false-positives to reduce recurring scan failures.
 * Output currently available as CLI, JSON or JUnit XML.
