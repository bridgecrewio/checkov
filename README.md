## Description
Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code. It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform and detects security and compliance misconfigurations. 

Checkov is written in Python and provides a simple method to write and manage policies. It follows the CIS Foundations benchmarks where applicable.

 ## Features

 * [60+ built-in policies](docs/3.Scans/resource-scans.md) cover security and compliance best practices for AWS, Azure & Google Cloud.
 * Scans Terraform and AWS CloudFormation configurations.
 * Policies support evaluation of variables to their optional default value.
 * Supports in-line suppression of accepted risks or false-positives to reduce recurring scan failures.
 * Output currently available as CLI, JSON or JUnit XML.

## Getting started
### Installation

```sh
pip install checkov
```

### Configure an input folder

```sh
checkov -d /user/path/to/iac/code
```
Or a specific file
```sh
checkov -f /user/tf/example.tf
```
or
```sh
checkov -f /user/cloudformation/example.yml
```

### Scan result sample (CLI)

```sh
Passed Checks: 1, Failed Checks: 1, Suppressed Checks: 0
Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
/main.tf:
	 Passed for resource: aws_s3_bucket.template_bucket 
Check: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
/../regionStack/main.tf:
	 Failed for resource: aws_s3_bucket.sls_deployment_bucket_name       
```

Start using Checkov by reading the [Getting Started](docs/1.Introduction/Getting%20Started.md) page.

### Using Docker

```sh
docker pull bridgecrew/checkov
docker run -t -v /user/tf:/tf bridgecrew/checkov -d /tf
```
### Suppressing/Ignoring a check
Like any static-analysis tool it is limited by its analysis scope. 
For example, if a resource is managed manually, or using subsequent configuration management tooling, 
a suppression can be inserted as a simple code annotation.

#### Suppression comment format

To skip a check on a given Terraform definition block, apply the following comment pattern inside it's scope:

`checkov:skip=<check_id>:<suppression_comment>`

* `<check_id>` is one of the [available check scanners](../3.Scans/resource-scans.md)
* `<suppression_comment>` is an optional suppression reason to be included in the output

#### Example
The following comment skip the `CKV_AWS_20` check on the resource identified by `foo-bucket`, where the scan checks if an AWS S3 bucket is private.
In the example, the bucket is configured with a public read access; Adding the suppress comment would skip the appropriate check instead of the check to fail.
```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
  region        = var.region
    #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:The bucket is a public static content host
  bucket        = local.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true
  acl           = "public-read"
}
```

The output would now contain a ``SKIPPED`` check result entry:

```bash
...
...
Check: "S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access."
	SKIPPED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.foo-bucket
	Suppress comment: The bucket is a public static content host
	File: /example_skip_acl.tf:1-25
	
...
```
