# Commit Message Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when writing commit messages to maintain a clear and organized project history.

-   **Subject Line:**
    -   Keep it short and descriptive (under 50 characters).
    -   Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
    -   Capitalize the first letter.
    -   Do not end with a period.

-   **Body (Optional):**
    -   Provide more context for the changes.
    -   Explain the "what" and "why" of the changes, not the "how".
    -   Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
    -   Wrap the body at 72 characters.

-   **Footer (Optional):**
    -   Reference any relevant issue or pull request numbers (e.g., "Closes #123").
