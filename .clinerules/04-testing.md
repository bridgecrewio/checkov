# Testing Guidelines

When adding new features or fixing bugs, it is important to add or update tests to ensure the code is working as expected and to prevent future regressions.

-   **Unit Tests:** For isolated components, add unit tests to verify their functionality.
-   **Integration Tests:** For features that involve multiple components, add integration tests to ensure they work together correctly.
-   **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage to ensure all parts of the code are tested.
